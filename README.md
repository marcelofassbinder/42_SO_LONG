# About ‚úç
So_long consists in creating a 2 dimensional game, where the player must collect every collectible present on the map and reach the exit. To achieve that, the player is able to move in 4 directions, up, down, right and left, by pressing W, S, D and A, respectively. To develop this project, I utilized the Minilibx, which is the official graphics library of 42 School. The Minilibx provides essential tools for opening windows, creating images, and handling keyboard and mouse events. n this project, I had the freedom to choose the resources I wanted. Inspired by my favorite cartoon, SpongeBob SquarePants, I decided to incorporate elements from the show into the game. SpongeBob himself became the player character, Krabby Patty served as the collectible, his pineapple house became the exit, jellyfish were introduced as enemies, sand acted as walls, and the sea bottom formed the backdrop for the game.
# Challenges and Learning Objectives üß†
- Graphics Programming: This project provides an opportunity to learn about graphics programming, particularly in a 2D game environment. Understanding how to render images, create visual effects, and manage game elements on the screen are essential skills that can be developed through so_long.
- Event Handling: Capturing keyboard and mouse events, to control the player and close the game; implementing player movement logic based on these events; detecting colisions between the player and map elements. 
- Resource Management: Managing game resources such as textures and maps is a key aspect of the project development.
- Data Structures Organization: Working with different structs for position, image, map and game made the game logic easier to understand, modify, and potentially reuse in future projects.
# Map üó∫Ô∏è
The map needs to be constructed with the following rules:
- Must contain these elements: WALL:``1``, FLOOR:``0``, PLAYER:``P``, COLLECTIBLE:``C``, EXIT:``E`` and, for the bonus part, ENEMY:``J``.
- Must be rectangular and surrounded by walls.
- Must contain a valid path, it means that the player can collect all the collectibles and reach the map exit.
- Example of a valid map:

  ```text
  111111111111111
  10001C0000000C1
  100010010110001
  1P00100101100E1
  11C000010C11111
  111111111111111
# Game Rules üéÆ
The player starts at the spawn position ``P`` and needs to walk through the map avoiding the obstacles ``1`` and enemies (bonus) ``J``, collect all the collectibles ``C`` and reach the map exit ``E``. If you collide with an enemy, the game is over, the window is closed and a message indicates the user lost.

Movement:
- ``W`` or ‚¨ÜÔ∏è - Move the player up.
- ``A`` or ‚¨ÖÔ∏è - Move the player to the left.
- ``S`` or ‚¨áÔ∏è - Move the player down.
- ``D`` or ‚û°Ô∏è - Move the player to the right.

Close the window:
- ``ESC`` or click ‚ùå

# Bonus ‚≠ê
For the bonus section, we were required to add some extra features as:
- Creating enemies for the game.
- Making the player lose when they touch an enemy patrol.
- Adding some sprite animation.
- Displaying the movement count directly on screen instead of writing it in the shell.
- I also implemented random movement for the enemies,, by using the ``rand()`` function to generate unpreddicatble moves, making the game harder and adding an element of challenge and excitement to the gameplay.

# Usage üñ•Ô∏è
To install and play so_long, follow these steps:
- First, make sure you have the following dependencies installed in your machine: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection), X11 libraries and development headers and Minilibx: a simple X-Window (X11R6)
- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:marcelofassbinder/42_SO_LONG.git
```
- Navigate to the project directory and run ``make`` to compile the program:
```bash
cd 42_SO_LONG
make
```
- Run the program providing a valid map, for example:
```bash
./so_long maps/map1.ber
```
You can replace the ```maps/map1.ber``` for any valid map of your choice. The program will read the input and start the game. Good luck!

- To enjoy the bonus part, follow:
```bash
make bonus
```
- Run the program providing a valid map, for example:
```bash
./so_long_bonus maps/bonus/bonus1.ber
```
You can replace the ```maps/bonus/bonus1.ber``` for any valid map of your choice. The program will read the input and start the game. Good luck!

# Norminette üíÇüèª
At 42 School, we need to follow some strict rules when writing our code. These rules are described in the Norm and checked by the formidable `norminette`. Here are some of them:
```
- No for, do...while, switch, case, goto, ternary operators and variable-length arrays are allowed
- Each function must be maximum 25 lines
- One single variable declaration per line
- You can‚Äôt declare more than 5 variables per function
- You can't write more than 5 functions per file
...
```
