# About ‚úç
So_long consists in creating a 2 dimensional game, where the player must collect every collectible present on the map and reach the exit. To achieve that, the player is able to move in 4 directions, up, down, right and left, by pressing W, S, D and A, respectively. To develop this project, I utilized the Minilibx, which is the official graphics library of 42 School. The Minilibx provides essential tools for opening windows, creating images, and handling keyboard and mouse events. n this project, I had the freedom to choose the resources I wanted. Inspired by my favorite cartoon, SpongeBob SquarePants, I decided to incorporate elements from the show into the game. SpongeBob himself became the player character, Krabby Patty served as the collectible, his pineapple house became the exit, jellyfish were introduced as enemies, sand acted as walls, and the sea bottom formed the backdrop for the game.
# Challenges and Learning Objectives üß†
- Graphics Programming: This project provides an opportunity to learn about graphics programming, particularly in a 2D game environment. Understanding how to render images, create visual effects, and manage game elements on the screen are essential skills that can be developed through so_long.
- Event Handling: Capturing keyboard and mouse events, to control the player and close the game; implementing player movement logic based on these events; detecting colisions between the player and map elements. 
- Resource Management: Managing game resources such as textures and maps is a key aspect of the project development.
- Data Structures Organization: Working with different structs for position, image, map and game made the game logic easier to understand, modify, and potentially reuse in future projects.
# Map üó∫Ô∏è
The map needs to be constructed with the following rules:
- Must contain these elements: WALL:``1``, FLOOR:``0``, PLAYER:``P``, COLLECTIBLE:``C``, EXIT:``E`` and, for the bonus part, ENEMY:``J``.
- Must be rectangular and surrounded by walls.
- Must contain a valid path, it means that the player can collect all the collectibles and reach the map exit.
- Example of a valid map:

  ```text
  111111111111111
  10001C0000000C1
  100010010110001
  1P00100101100E1
  11C000010C11111
  111111111111111
# Game Rules üéÆ
The player starts at the spawn position ``P`` and needs to walk through the map avoiding the obstacles ``1`` and enemies (bonus) ``J``, collect all the collectibles ``C`` and reach the map exit ``E``. If you collide with an enemy, the game is over, the window is closed and a message indicates the user lost.

Movement:
- ``W`` or ‚¨ÜÔ∏è - Move the player up.
- ``A`` or ‚¨ÖÔ∏è - Move the player to the left.
- ``S`` or ‚¨áÔ∏è - Move the player down.
- ``D`` or ‚û°Ô∏è - Move the player to the right.

Close the window:
- ``ESC`` or click ‚ùå
# Turk Algorithm ‚öôÔ∏è
The Turk Algorithm was developed by another 42 student called [Ali Ogun](https://github.com/ayogun) and it is detailed in his article ["Push Swap ‚Äî A journey to find most efficient sorting algorithm"](https://medium.com/@ayogun/push-swap-c1f5d2d41e97). Essentially, the algorithm functions when we have more than 3 numbers as arguments. We begin by pushing the numbers from ``stack_a`` a to ``stack_b`` until only 3 elements remain in ``stack_a``. However, we do this in descending order because later we will need to push the numbers back to ``stack_a``, and they will be automatically organized.

To achieve this efficiently, we define a target node in ``stack_b`` for every node in ``stack_a``, which will be the smallest and closest number to the node in ``stack_a`` present in ``stack_b``. If a smaller number does not exist, the target will become the highest element in ``stack_b``. After that, we calculate the "cost" of each node to be pushed to the right index in ``stack_b``. Finally, we choose the cheapest node, rotate the stack to bring the node to the top (if needed), and then push it.

When only three elements are left in ``stack_a``, we begin pushing the numbers back from ``stack_b`` in a similar manner. However, the target node now becomes the highest and closest number in ``stack_a``. In case a higher number does not exist, the smallest element in ``stack_b`` will then become the target.

Finally, after pushing all the elements from ``stack_b``, if necessary, we organize ``stack_a`` by rotating it until the smallest number is at the top. This ensures that all elements are sorted in ascending order, concluding the program.

# Bonus ‚≠ê
For the bonus section, we were required to develop a program called "checker". Similar to the push_swap program, checker takes a list of integers as arguments and forms a stack with those numbers. Afterward, the program awaits instructions that will be provided on the standard input. Once all the operations are inputted, the program read line by line, employing the [get_next_line](https://github.com/marcelofassbinder/42_GET_NEXT_LINE) function, and proceeds to execute the operations on the stack.

After performing the provided instructions, if ``stack a`` is sorted, and ``stack b`` is empty, the program displays ``OK`` followed by a new line. In any other scenario, the checker outputs ``KO`` followed by a new line. If an error occurs, the program follows the same behavior as push_swap, printing ``Error`` and a new line.

# Usage üñ•Ô∏è
To install and use push_swap, follow these steps:
- Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:marcelofassbinder/42_PUSH_SWAP.git
```
- Navigate to the project directory and run ``make`` to compile the program:
```bash
cd 42_PUSH_SWAP
make
```
- Run the program providing a list of integers, for example:
```bash
./push_swap 42 24 -6 8 -50
```
- The program will output the operations applied to sort the given numbers, for example:
```bash
pb
pb
rra
pa
ra
pa
ra
```
- To use the checker, do:
```bash
make bonus
```
- Run the program, passing a list of integers as arguments, for example:
```bash
./checker 7 -12 35 42
```
- Now, give the instructions you think will sort the numbers, and press Ctrl + D to finish. For example:
 ```bash
 pb
rra
rra
pa
ra
ra
ra
```
If the operations sorted the stack, checker will print ``OK``. Otherwise ``KO``, and in case of error, ``Error``.

# Norminette üíÇüèª
At 42 School, we need to follow some strict rules when writing our code. These rules are described in the Norm and checked by the formidable `norminette`. Here are some of them:
```
- No for, do...while, switch, case, goto, ternary operators and variable-length arrays are allowed
- Each function must be maximum 25 lines
- One single variable declaration per line
- You can‚Äôt declare more than 5 variables per function
- You can't write more than 5 functions per file
...
```
